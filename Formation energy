The calculated formation energy for these systems are: -4.03 eV (CCO), -1.04 eV (CICO), and -0.72 eV (ICO), respectively. It is foreseeable that the overall stability of this alloy may be influenced by the percentage of these two atoms. These values suggest that the synthesis of XClO (X=Cr, Ir) is highly favorable. All these structure features are closely associated with their thermodynamics stability, electrical and mechanical properties, as well as their inner heat transport efficiency.

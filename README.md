# JanusXCIO-Heattransport

In this study, our focus was on investigating the thermal properties of Janus XCIO (X=Cr, Ir) systems, aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanism and determining factors governing their internal heat transport.

We advocate the utilization of first-principles calculations for optimizing configurations, both the minimal energy and magnetic moment convergence are considered. Additionally, we suggest employing convex hull analysis as an optional method for systematically selecting configurations based on stability, particularly with regard to the evolution of the Ir/Cr ratio. An illustrative example of convex hull analysis for XCIO (X=Cr, Ir) systems is provided for reference (R1).

The theoretical insights gleaned indicate a negative correlation between the stability of this Janus material and the percentage of Ir atoms within the range of 0.25 to 1.0. Across varying alloying ratios of Ir:(Ir+Cr) from 0 to 1.0, configurations with Ir:(Ir+Cr) = 0.25-0.5 demonstrate stability, rendering them suitable for heat transport mechanism investigations. Furthermore, we recommend utilizing DFT optimization for recurrent validation purposes.
